<h2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p>
  JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core components of other software systems, most notably servers and a variety of applications.

  Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
